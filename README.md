# Building-a-Neural-Network-only-using-Numpy
The goal of this project is to understand how neural network and deep learning models works by building two neural networks without tensorflow or pytorch. 
The first NN will be trying to identify which point coordinate of a spiral belongs to which spiral class. 
The second NN will try to identify hand written numbers using the MNIST dataset. 
The third NN will try to identify a type of clothing from images using the MNIST dataset


# Order of documentation 
Please follow through these files first. Neural Network Basics => Forward Propagation => Cost Functions => Backward Propapagt
ion => Stochiastic Gradient Descent

The MNIST Digit Dataset and MNIST Fashion Dataset files hold the neural network model to process the two datasets.
